Title:
Next.js Turbopack Root Detection Issue

Date:
12-02-2026

Project:
PFG (Next.js 16)

Problem:
When running "npm run dev", the project failed with a Turbopack build error.

Error Message:
"We couldn't find the Next.js package (next/package.json) 
from the project directory: C:\Users\Dipak\Desktop\PFG\app"

Root Cause:
There was another Next.js project folder (Student-initiative-GNG-) 
inside the main project directory.

Turbopack incorrectly inferred the workspace root as:
C:\Users\Dipak\Desktop\PFG\app

Instead of:
C:\Users\Dipak\Desktop\PFG

Because of this, Next.js could not locate next/package.json.

Solution Steps:

1) Removed the nested project folder:
   (Moved "Student-initiative-GNG-" outside the main project directory)

2) Deleted build cache folder:
   rmdir /s /q .next

3) Deleted dependencies folder:
   rmdir /s /q node_modules

4) Reinstalled dependencies:
   npm install

5) Started development server:
   npm run dev

Result:
Project successfully started on localhost without errors.

Key Learnings:
- Keep only ONE Next.js project per root directory.
- Avoid nested package.json files inside a Next.js project.
- Turbopack strictly depends on correct workspace root detection.
- Always verify project structure when facing build errors.
